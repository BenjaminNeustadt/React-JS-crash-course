# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You can turn this into a full stack application by having a backend, some kind of API that you can make requests to, and fetch data from (think about having a local database for this, either MONGODB NOSQL), which we might do at the end with Json server.

Each component has its peice of state, component level state , not App level state

Might be a little initimidating at first, but:
To do stuff like this in vanilla javasciprt is much more messy and unorganised, and difficult

build folder is where you push to production.



### When ready to deploy: 

- stop the server
`npm run build`

creates static assets in build folder

then to try locally, we can install the npm serve package globally

To install: 

`sudo npm -i -g serve`

insert password

can now:

`serve -s build -p 8000' the build folder on port 8000

now local host 3000 isnt working, its on 8000

Could delete all the rest of the folders and this would still work, because this is our production build.

we have production build and dev environment now.
#### Now we keep going to build mock backend

we use Json server, to make mock API with our own server:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

can make post resquests, put requests, as if it were a real backend
